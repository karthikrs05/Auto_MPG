#Auto MPG Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains a project for predicting the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) of automobiles using linear regression. The dataset used in this project is the Auto MPG dataset, which includes various features such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin of the cars.
Dataset
The Auto MPG dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains the following features:

mpg: Miles per gallon
cylinders: Number of cylinders
displacement: Engine displacement 
horsepower: Engine horsepower
weight: Vehicle weight 
acceleration: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph
model year: Model year of the car
origin: Origin of the car 
car name: Name of the car 

Requirements
Python 
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
